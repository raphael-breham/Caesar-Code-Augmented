# Ceasar-Code-Augmented
The famous Ceasar Code revisited. This version allows, unlike the common one, for each word to have its own specific shift number depending on 2 factors : 
    1) the number of letters in the word
     2) its index in the sentence that determines if the shift will be positive (shift to the right of the alphabet) or negative (shift to the left of the alphabet).
